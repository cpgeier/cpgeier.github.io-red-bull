      <description>Alex working hard on our difficult problem
  Progress For this part of the course we were tasked with making the car autonomously follow the right wall. This involving implimenting perception and control into our F1/10th scale vehicle.
To track the wall we utilized the LIDAR present on the car. By reading the sensor data using ROS we were able to impliment nodes to track the car distance from the wall at certain angles.</description>

      <description>Rahul and Alex working on keyboard control
  Demo: Steering control
Throttle control
Progress Our team met on Sunday, 31 March 2019 to work on Assignment 3 - F1/10 Teleop. Following the directions in the assignment specifications and the lecture slides, we were successfully able to modify the provided talker.py and keyboard.py files to accept keyboard input and control the F1/10 vehicle.
While modifying the keyboard.py file, we had to examine the curses python library to determine which key matched curses.</description>
